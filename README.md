## Problem Statement 
FCAT wants to create an interactive decentralized finance (DeFi) dashboard 
that provides users with market data and DeFi functions. This interactive 
DeFi dashboard not only tracks data trends in real-time, but also provides 
new functions to users, including but not limited to reflecting potential 
future trends and points of public interest.

## Goals
Explore potential future trends and points of public interest based on 
previous research and learning on DeFi, and then propose a detailed 
product development plan, including development details, key features, and 
all functions of an interactive dashboard.
